# Requests

## Requesting Lists

The `useRequest` hook can be used to declare our data needs for a specific screen or component tree. At the root of our app, we can request a list of posts like this:

```tsx
import { useRequest } from 'react-fate';
import { PostCard, PostView } from './PostCard.tsx';

export function App() {
  const { posts } = useRequest({ posts: { list: PostView } });
  return posts.map((post) => <PostCard key={post.id} post={post} />);
}
```

This component suspends or throws errors, which bubble up to the nearest error boundary. Wrap your component tree with `ErrorBoundary` and `Suspense` components to show error and loading states:

```tsx
<ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorComponent}>
  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading…</div>}>
    <App />
  </Suspense>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> `useRequest` might issue multiple requests which are automatically batched together by tRPC's [HTTP Batch Link](https://trpc.io/docs/client/links/httpBatchLink) into a single network request.

## Requesting Objects by ID

If you want to fetch data for a single object instead of a list, you can specify the `id` and the associated `view` like this:

```tsx
const { post } = useRequest({
  post: { id: '12', view: PostView },
});
```

If you want to fetch multiple objects by their IDs, you can use the `ids` field:

```tsx
const { posts } = useRequest({
  posts: { ids: ['6', '7'], view: PostView },
});
```

## Other Types of Requests

For any other queries, pass only the `type` and `view`:

```tsx
const { viewer } = useRequest({
  viewer: { view: UserView },
});
```

## Request Arguments

You can pass arguments to `useRequest` calls. This is useful for pagination, filtering, or sorting. For example, to fetch the first 10 posts, you can do the following:

```tsx
const { posts } = useRequest({
  posts: {
    args: { first: 10 },
    list: PostView,
  },
});
```

## Request Modes

`useRequest` supports different request modes to control caching and data freshness. The available modes are:

- `cache-first` (_default_): Returns data from the cache if available, otherwise fetches from the network.
- `stale-while-revalidate`: Returns data from the cache and simultaneously fetches fresh data from the network.
- `network-only`: Always fetches data from the network, bypassing the cache.

You can pass the request mode as an option to `useRequest`:

```tsx
const { posts } = useRequest(
  {
    posts: { list: PostView },
  },
  {
    mode: 'stale-while-revalidate',
  },
);
```
