# Views

## Defining Views

Let's start by defining a simple view for a blog's `Post` component. fate requires you to explicitly "select" each field that you plan to use in your components. Here is how you can define a view for a `Post` entity that has `title` and `content` fields:

```tsx
import { view } from 'react-fate';

type Post = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
};

export const PostView = view<Post>()({
  title: true,
  content: true,
});
```

_Note: The `Post` type above is an example. In a real application, this type is defined on the server and imported into your client code._

## Resolving a View with `useView`

Now we can use the view that we defined in a `PostCard` React component to resolve the data against a reference of an individual `Post`:

```tsx
import { useView, ViewRef } from 'react-fate';

export const PostCard = ({ post: postRef }: { post: ViewRef<'Post'> }) => {
  const post = useView(PostView, postRef);

  return (
    <Card>
      <h2>{post.title}</h2>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

A `ViewRef` is a reference to an object of a specific type, in this case a `Post`. It contains the unique ID for the object, the type name (as `__typename`) and some fate-specific metadata. fate creates and manages these references for you, and you can pass them around your components as needed.

Components using `useView` listen to changes for all selected fields. When data changes, fate re-renders all of the fields that depend on that data. For example, if the `title` of the `Post` changes, the `PostCard` component re-renders with new data. However, if a different field such as `likes` that isn't selected in `PostView` changes, the `PostCard` component will not re-render.

## Fetching Data with `useRequest`

Now that we defined our view and component, we fetch the data from the server using the `useRequest` hook from fate. This hook allows us to declare what data we need for a specific screen or component tree. At the root of our `HomePage` component, we can request a list of posts like this:

```tsx
import { useRequest } from 'react-fate';
import { PostCard, PostView } from './PostCard.tsx';

export function HomePage() {
  const { posts } = useRequest({
    posts: { root: PostView, type: 'Post' },
  } as const);

  return posts.map((post) => <PostCard key={post.id} post={post} />);
}
```

This component suspends or throws errors, which bubble up to the nearest error boundary. Wrap your component tree with `ErrorBoundary` and `Suspense` components to show error and loading states:

```tsx
<ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorComponent}>
  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading…</div>}>
    <HomePage />
  </Suspense>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

## Composing Views

In the above example we are defining a single view for a `Post`. One of fate's core strengths is view composition. Let's say we want to show the author's name along with the post. A simple way to do this is by adding an `author` field to the `PostView` with a concrete selection:

```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import { useRequest, useView, ViewRef } from 'react-fate';

export const PostView = view<Post>()({
  author: {
    id: true,
    name: true,
  },
  title: true,
  content: true,
});

const PostCard = ({ postRef }: { postRef: ViewRef<'Post'> }) => {
  const post = useView(PostView, postRef);
  return (
    <Card>
      <h2>{post.title}</h2>
      <p>by {post.author.name}</p>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

This code fetches the author associated with the Post and makes it available to the `PostCard` component. However, this approach has some downsides:

1. The `author` selection is tightly coupled to the `PostView`. If we want to use the author's data in another component, we would need to duplicate the field selection.
1. If the `author` has more fields that we want to use in other components, we would need to add them to the `PostView`, leading to overfetching.
1. We cannot reuse the `author` field selection in other views or components.

In fate, views are composable and reusable. Instead of inlining the selection, we can define a `UserView` and compose it into the `PostView` like this:

```tsx
import type { Post, User } from '@your-org/server/trpc/views';
import { view } from 'react-fate';

export const UserView = view<User>()({
  profilePicture: true,
  id: true,
  name: true,
});

export const PostView = view<Post>()({
  author: UserView,
  content: true,
  id: true,
  title: true,
});
```

Now we can create a separate `UserCard` component that uses our `UserView`:

```tsx
import { useView, ViewRef } from 'react-fate';

export const UserCard = ({ user: userRef }: { user: ViewRef<'User'> }) => {
  const user = useView(UserView, userRef);

  return (
    <div>
      <img src={user.profilePicture} alt={user.name} />
      <p>{user.name}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

And update `PostCard` to use our `UserCard` component:

```tsx
import { UserCard } from './UserCard.tsx';

export const PostCard = ({ post: postRef }: { post: ViewRef<'Post'> }) => {
  const post = useView(PostView, postRef);

  return (
    <Card>
      <h2>{post.title}</h2>
      <UserCard user={post.author} />
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

## View Spreads

When building complex UIs, you will often build multiple components that share the same data requirements. In fate, you can use view spreads to compose such views together. This is similar to GraphQL fragment spreads, but works with plain JavaScript objects.

Let's assume we want to fetch and display additional information about the author in the `PostCard`, such as their bio. Instead of directly assigning our `UserView` to the `author` field, we can instead spread it and add the `bio` field:

```tsx
export const PostView = view<Post>()({
  author: {
    ...UserView,
    bio: true,
  },
  content: true,
  id: true,
  title: true,
});
```

Now the `PostCard` component can access the `bio` field of the author:

```tsx
export const PostCard = ({ post: postRef }: { post: ViewRef<'Post'> }) => {
  const post = useView(PostView, postRef);

  return (
    <Card>
      <h2>{post.title}</h2>
      <UserCard author={post.author} />
      {/* Accessing the bio field */}
      <p>{post.author.bio}</p>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

We can also spread multiple views together. For example, if we have another view called `UserStatsView` that selects some statistics about the user, we can include it in the `PostView` like this:

```tsx
export const UserStatsView = view<User>()({
  postCount: true,
  followerCount: true,
});

export const PostView = view<Post>()({
  author: {
    ...UserView,
    ...UserStatsView,
    bio: true,
  },
  content: true,
  id: true,
  title: true,
});
```

Views are opaque objects. Even if you select the same field multiple times through different views, the composed object won't have conflicting fiels or result in TypeScript errors. fate automatically deduplicates fields during runtime and ensures that each field is only fetched once.

## `useView` and Suspense

We learned that `useRequest` is responsible for fetching data from the server and `useView` is used for reading data from the cache. In some situations data may not be available in the cache and `useView` might need to suspend the component to fetch only the missing data. Once that data is fetched and written to the cache, the component resumes rendering.

_Tip: You can test this behavior in development mode with Fast Refresh (HMR) enabled in your bundler. When you edit the selection of a view, components using that view will suspend, fetch the missing data, and then resume rendering._

## Type Safety and Data Masking

fate provides guarantees through TypeScript and during runtime that prevent you from accessing data that wasn't selected in a component. This ensures that you declare all the data dependencies at the right level in your component tree, and prevents accidental coupling between components.

In the below example, we forgot to select the `content` of a `Post`. As a result, type-checks fail and the `content` field is undefined during runtime:

```tsx
const PostView = view<Post>()({
  id: true,
  title: true,
  // `content: true` is omitted.
});

const PostCard = ({ post: postRef }: { post: ViewRef<'Post'> }) => {
  const post = useView(PostView, postRef);

  return (
    <Card>
      <h2>{post.title}</h2>
      {/* TypeScript errors here, and `post.content` is undefined during runtime */}
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

Views can only be resolved against refs that include that view directly or via view spreads. If a component tries to resolve a view against a ref that isn't linked, it will throw an error during runtime:

```tsx
const PostDetailView = view<Post>()({
  content: true,
});

const AnotherPostView = view<Post>()({
  content: true,
});

const PostView = view<Post>()({
  id: true,
  title: true,
  ...AnotherPostView,
});

const PostCard = ({ post: postRef }: { post: ViewRef<'Post'> }) => {
  const post = useView(PostView, postRef);
  return <PostDetail post={post} />;
};

const PostDetail = ({ post: postRef }: { post: ViewRef<'Post'> }) => {
  // This throws because the post reference passed into this component
  // is of type `AnotherPostView`, not `PostDetailView`.
  const post = useView(PostDetailView, postRef);
};
```

ViewRefs carry a set of view names they can resolve. `useView` throws if a ref does not include the required view.

## Request Modes

`useRequest` supports different request modes to control caching and data freshness. The available modes are:

- `cache-first` (_default_): Returns data from the cache if available, otherwise fetches from the network.
- `stale-while-revalidate`: Returns data from the cache and simultaneously fetches fresh data from the network.
- `network-only`: Always fetches data from the network, bypassing the cache.

You can pass the request mode as an option to `useRequest`:

```tsx
const { posts } = useRequest(
  {
    posts: { root: PostView, type: 'Post' },
  },
  { mode: 'stale-while-revalidate' },
);
```

## Request Arguments

You can pass arguments to `useRequest` calls. This is useful for pagination, filtering, or sorting. For example, to fetch the first 10 posts, you can do the following:

```tsx
const { posts } = useRequest({
  posts: {
    args: { first: 10 },
    root: PostView,
    type: 'Post',
  },
});
```
